          <p>...as was his dream, his hearts desire. But I fear you dont understand the price, and once you have it ,the price of getting what you want is getting what once you wanted. I saw you and I fell—suddenly, endless .Hit me too like a truck. Funny you still hit me like a truck no matter what the outcome. The poison still tasty. Ever drulled for poison? I have. That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you. To fall for you. I don't know why you blame me than God the clay master or your Mum the clay tender. Blame them not me.  Ni shida yao hawakukubandika mapua kubwa bila meno. But I guess this are not news to you. Many people might tell you but can you feel it from them? I know you do from me. Or starting with this if neer. I swear na si mstari I literally skip a beat when I see a photo of you or when I even think I've seen you on the road or in town. Anyway nione mbleina tu nikisema izi vitu😂 Pia ww ulikua mrazi na naona bado uko nayo. To say the truth I might melt a lil seen you again. Might hide it a lil but I don't think I'll be able to fully. Mostly because I wouldn't know what to say but I will deffinetely run after you. I've done that a couple of times, only non was you. Nilikua tu naoneka fala</p>
          
          <p>Najua unasoma ii shit ukisema kijana haezi move on. Naeza jaribu. I did briefly for 10yrs look where it got me, she fucking came back. </p>
          
          <p>Unanibamba😅 tu sana.If you really serious about your love life and not just worldly desires then damn, 'Can I ride with you? you can hold my ruger' Its my curiosity killing me at this point not even the rejection. Like why did you accept my request, came back to me, told me all you told me agreed to meet me even after all those months, you fuckin shaved🥵😌 you lil nasty thot🍉 mistake or not😂💜 not a mistake somebody wanted the coco slippperrrry somebody lying saying we couldn't be a thing before we met😅. Or your body craved me or the feeling? people fuck and mov on like nothing happened, retards. Funny we almost fucked. I'll need better context, seems I'm not your level or something. Of which I'll ask how low is that bar set? Why the hell did you look at me like that knowing I was gonna fumble? when we sat next to each other eye to eye? I cant tell the details well. Here at least. CMW .That dude gon be a lil lucky. He just needs to be a lil more careful next time(me speaking to the future me) Na kwani uliipaka nn ju imekua ngumu kwangu kukusahau? Na nilkua nashanga io taste ya pinnaple strawberry punch imetoka wapi na niliskia inaonjanga steel copper wire. Maze siezi enda clubing adi kwa amani. Nikiona stripper na fumble. Ata siezi enjoy kwa amani najipata nimedrift kwa zako. Kenye ilikua imekosa tu ni pole kule lulu😏 ju the way that black and white thing hugged those peaches🍑 Na zilikua bouncy and juicy damnnnn🥵 I know you liked me playin with😏 they liked it, they would bounce with excitment like when a little girls Dad comes back years later. Sit on me again🥺 I'd rather not breathe you on top than you away hating on me. Siezi adi skia jina ina rhyme na 'Sam'  Naskia mtu anasema today the 'sun is hot' me naskia Sam is hot nachizi. Heri mtu aite jua. Ningekua na Kingdom yangu ningeburn io jina. Naskia imetajwa " guards execute that fucker"  isikue ulinitepa. Not cool. Can we make our fantasy Kingdom together🥺 we can make more of how you want but not Sophia themed you know what I'm talking bout😅</p>
          
          <p>Izi ndo matime nilikua natoka shule boarding narudi nikiski kunamtu anasema lazima ni put a ring on her💍😂😂 how innocent and Naive.Usijali. Still rings in my head 👾. Willing to make your dream come true to the old ages. Coz if you let me mine automatically alligns I wanna grow old beside you. Or not.Ama unasema ilikua utoto mingi tu? utashtuka ulikua manaseer. With those eyes siezi shtuka. Mesmerized me the day we met. Na nikieza kuambia nilikua nataka kutoka nje nichukue breather io day si ati ni shugli😅 haiya</p>
          
          <p>Mi sikuona ikiwa utoto saaanaa ivooo lakni. Nilikumbushwa io story niliishaa😂😂</p>
          
          <p>Experiences zako ni kitu moja nimechora kama tatoo. Sithani itawahi niondokea. Sijawahi kimbishwa ivo na anybody, rather siezi itikia kukimbizwa ivo na anybody tena for sure. No matter the outcome this 2 months will mould my coming descisions for sure All this bitches got nothin on me and never will. Forever loyal to you. But I would feel awful If I dont get a chance. But I cannot force shit, just try. Only Time tells the true tale all other things are mere thoughts realities we try to allign with time. Take it as it is. Swallow water if you have to. Matter of fact come let me give you something that will help swallow.</p>
          
          <p>Anyway, kuongea na ww ilifanya nijue kuna memoria hujasahau. Ata useme our past was awful. You showed me it wasnt purely as you say nor as I say.</p>
          
          <p>Acha nkushoo, ata mm sijui hii ni nn. Might be anything. Might be nothing. Might be I just hate losing playing games with love. Either way niko confused. But na feel kitu. But si anger but ni kitu haitaki niondokee. We ni ka uko na vision and I aint init already if the other side was your choice😅Goddamit should have been more silent. Izo calls mingi mingi ndo ilifanya nislip words sikua nafaa inaonekana😅 bado nili mean kila shiet, mostly.</p>
          
          <p>Still, Dont matter the ties or distance for me that much. Not as you think. Not for now. I aint going soft next time we meet I can switch lanes faster than I can undress. Can you unblock I get the chance to ignore you too. When blocked it feels like cheating or forced.</p>
          
          <p>You think I dont see you dr9? 47 or not dont think I be talking bout like I wanna 69... If I dont got to know you more than I do</p>
          
          <p>Najua hungefikiria naeza fanya kitu ka hii. Ama uli expect ju nimeji exposee kiasi 😏 it was a matter oftime anyway. Come nikushoo vitu naeza fanya, or not your loss. Men are the only ones who love, Women tend to Love the moment thats why they usually have backups or replacements and move on faster.But I know the spark aint dimmed. Just a gutt feeling. I saw it different with us. A connection or bond that looks hard to bend. Thats why I was mesmarized. I would usually ask myself whats this? You know where I stay and the girls I tend to meet often. So I did not beleive you at first. If you did all this It is kind of my fault I didn't move steady also the timing played part. Never gave you the story. Might talk. Or not.</p>
          
          <p>I also need a sexy Lawyer too. Might come in handy with my 🧠</p>
          
          <p>also I like stars. They give a sense of parmanence.</p>
          
          <p>Look at the difference💜 also look at the similarity💜 of the 2 photos. 2 in 1 you look great in both you look different in both but the same in both. Rare. Like I told you...</p>
          
          <p><strong>OPALEFFECT</strong></p>
          
          <p>Just dont treat me like them niggaz you know I aint those basic bros . You aint tasted divine yet. Dont run. I never have never will.</p>
          <p>Your smile just a little too gorgeuos to just unrememmber Can we make up dont have to make love although you got me addicted. My drug dealer wants to leave me an addict. Don't you think thats messed lmao good church girl and tings</p>

          <p>Even if you choose the other side, I still cant believe I fumbled and stumbled on this girl😅😔damnnn can't even think straight. I'm goddamn serious I need you not only as my partner. You my support. I'm not ok talk to me before they take over. I can hear them screaming every night. Keeping me awake, draining me. I dont know for how long I can hold ,alone.
            Yes I might have done did the dumbest thing by falling for you. Thats why you need to hold me down before the wind takes me away. I aint built like you. And I know you feel the same way otherwise my instincts would be wrong na ndo natumia hapa. Since I dont know what to do and I have no one willing to teach me the correct way then why not use my instincts. I nerver even knew a thing like love language till you taught. I need you badbad
          </p>
          <P>This was gonna be one of the ways I was to ask you out. I pictured it so lively. I had a lot to show you and remove that negative mindset you planted of me. When you told me you felt not much from me when we kids I knew my moves were to be different. And I had to put a lot. Thats why I hesitated the closeclose meet up. I wanted it to feel special when the time comes, both of us.

          <p>Can I tell you somethin' Crazy too I never thought you'd be my type too since we met at the beginning . I actually thought no one can be my type around here. Was into other drunk types. Till that day you came from school and I switched school. The timing was perfect since my thoughts started tuning to you prier that moment. So I guess it was mutual. That was not naive the way we looked at each other we craved for each other. I saw you young at first. I said fuck dat from that day. Started with a hug. Ended in kisses. Learn from you to be a kisser even then.My first real experience. No lie. Was void before. I was actually gonna give up on things till you came back. And I was like mmh maybe just maybe. Then I started doing things different not knowing or caring how it may affect this us. My bad. Should have gone harder than my D when you crossed your legs sitting on your side. Gotta bounce it one more time before you even think of leaving me.</p>
          
          <p>I guess its why I'm still here. Unless I wasnt your first then I am wrong in everything. Dilussional asf. Ivo ndo naskia naitwa na ww skuizi. Cant a man dream and archive the desired, I mean don't you dream too?</p>
          
          <p>If you knew how resentful I tried being. It kept slipping I see that now. I'll explain when I want. I'm telling I got a lot to tell. </p>
          
          <p>The song TRAUMA is word for word what I'm trying to say, chill song, good song ? 🤔.</p>
          
          <p>We were gonna be high together. You fr sweared tukiwa rooftop I cant tell what went wrong. But can we fuck that shit out girl. Be straight with me. I'll crucify you for the nature of human longing is to be free.</p>
          
          <p>I'm not doing all this to prove a point. I think I'll continue doing that for a while as we discover this. Or maybe not. Naeza kua adi nakuchukia obsessively ata mm si get.</p>
          
          <p>Let me know when you want me to start showing what I'm saying, If it dont work out is cool. Might even be ur best man in your wedding😊 Then we can maybe think of Bonnie and Clyde'n our way out😵😂🔪 But we dont got to be a thing baby, at my own pase your own pleasure. At the end you won't have anything to think much.</p>
          
          <p>This aint love bombing😂 not yet at least😏</p>
          
          <p>Fair I add mine just incase it leaks😅 I guess this is us back in 2013. Ukiwa hizo photo session sikua ,nikiwa hukua. Its still in the web. Encrypted ,but you know how it goes when you come on top. It aint gonna be fun without you. Never will. I'll survive but I'll die.</p>
          <p>Ama unasema the shoe don't fit so no happy ending here😔 Its glass slippers you can melt it or just walk beare foot ju why a glass slippers?</p>

(reminds me of Spiderman and jane in spider man 3 only this time after eating each other out they kiss and go home) It consumes the male. Walks out elegant sassy but sexy. Abdomen High 🍑. But the male wants it. You know why, well they dont talk. Might be love or something. But the fact that something can be both Fatal and attractive is buy itself the ultimate addiction.</p>
        
        <p>The music you here when you open this page is a song you told me you love.</p>

        <p>I dont know whenever, I hear DREAMING it just gives me your vibe. Its ingrained in me already. Not the music but the feeling.And this girls play it a lot. PnD too</p>
        
        <p>Imagine the tourture😞 because sikuwahi realize wanamskizanga mpaka ww</p>
        
        <p>I also just Discovered my hypocrisy. I have never really done anything for you. Consider this my first sentimental attempt to what I'm to say and do till my last. I would literaly move the moon closer just for you to see what I'm saying</p>
        
        <p>My love Dangerous. And unstable. It needs someone with heart for sure. But nimeona venye unanichukulia hujui anything bado😅</p>
        
        <p>Without you love and sex are are two seperate things for me forever. Move on if you must but no this, ain't no one ever gonna be your biggest fan than me😔 never felt anything or anyone till you then left then voidness again then lulu then I died that day it seems. I've just realized late. You made me feel like a King. Dressed to my likeness. Do't get that a lot so excuse me if I'm obsessed. Din't I make you feel like a Black queen you are? If I'm not wrong I did acknowlegde my Queen. I bowed for my Royal ,technically from the back but yeah or you thought it was mixed feelings. I never bow to any other Queen. Loyalty. Never will. If you see me with any other or hear just know she will never get to be bowed by me. She gotta cheat for that. I dont get why you pretend it aint mutual.</p>
        
        <p>Its mostly not About you. But also about you. Its mostly about what I'm about to be. Its not gonna be full without you. Literally.</p>
        
        <p>I also like peaches 🍑. Not all types. You gotta be picky with that fruit. Its a delicate one. Thats why expensive. And a rare fruit. It needs good hands. The softer the better. It tends to harvest the juiciest fruits.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Tell yo Mama Hi😊</strong></p>
        
        <p>CALL ME but dont call me Crazy YET!! DONT STOP ME NOW</p>
        
        <p>PS: Its a disappearing browser. Will automatically delete in 2wks time.</p>
        
        <p>Trying to say uoy dmc so plizz cmw. I'll be waiting</p>
        
        <p>Na usini expose mm👺 hapo sasa mm ndo nitakudinya ww na nikukalie, si ww ulinikalia pia na sikua napumua😂😂😏💍</p>
        
        <p>Nikupatie clue ujue kama uyo your current mans ni ur mans or whoever kama mmeingia lulu kama sisi na hajakuambia tumbo ni kubwa dumb him quick.</p>
        
        <p>The only F.A.T girl I will find attractive under the sheets😊</p>
        <p>I've seen you are the types who say wait till I'm in the mood. I dont wanna explain how that is a very wrong mindset. You knew that already all I'll say I've seen my part. nerver patient with you. I focused on your body and forgot your mind. You wouldnt beleive even of I told you its new to me all this. But thats not the reason. I just wanna explain to you well over dinner or something. Anyday. I'll wait. And I know you joked about fiding a partner. Be a lil patient with me. I'll be the best for you. Promise that. (Wrote this later)</p>

        <p>I'm no Drake nor PND but my name still Bryson still a rocker. Give me the location. I learnt a thing or two since we met.😎 You havent hard the experince I dreamt I gave you. I want to share it. Physically this time. From those pretty chocolate toes to the smooth  legs up to the thighs
           to your stomach down to the thighs mapping it with my tougur and lips your look they can make the perfect topographical map for my fingures to explore, as I kiss you kiss me as I touch you touch me as I stare you stare back with those deep black eyes as I come back to the stomach you grab by back and hair as you did nails deep confused wheather Its sign I should stop or go deeper, rougher... nachizi staki kuendelea nitachizi. Maze nakuambia ni game over for me. We ni kama ulisurvive heart shot ama iko wounded? mm roho splatterd all over na ju tulikua pamoja ,on your body. Ww ndo uko na pieces zangu wewe ndo unaeza nirudishia akuna mtu mwingine
          so telling me I'll find another sounds like a stretch
        </p>
        
        <p>I don't even know if I'm doing corny things here or if you'll even like it. I also dont think I care if you do that much. Hii si for you its also for me. Nimejitengenezea pia</p>
        
        <p>But I also feel this would have been sugar melon sweet if it was in better terms😅</p>
        
        <p><strong>I just pressed the big red button😂</strong></p>
        
        <p>Damn that big read button😖memories😌 Damn that big red button Started all dat. Couldn't resist . But who wouldn't, remember I asked what the fuk, why does it taste like strawberrry pinapple punch😔Damn that big red button. The sweatest looking things are really sometimes the most poisonous.</p>
        
        <p>Was gonna put it in a yellow diamond pendant or somthin' maybe half black to match ur attitude half purple to mean love war. But I aint rich though,yet, a yellow diamond dagger will get if you choose this side. I know you will. Question is will I be patient enough till that day? or will you</p>
        
        <p>Its hard here gettin over you. I'm past this bitches,I think. Discovered a Woman. Now I just look at this bitches like souless dolls. Like you but uglier versions of you without the misrouted part</p>
        
        <p>I've been messing around with this game for a while till I saw how serious You are. Then I lost my cool. Then you blocked me, I knew I aint going back. This letter might look like damage controll. Because it kind of is. But remember I have been asking you for your photos. It was an Idea like this.</p>
        
        <p>It was sopposed to be a suprise, just to say forget the old me.</p>
        
        <p>If you knew how safe I played not to fumble into you 😔. I have a problem with hot girls that treat me good. Especially after they touch my hair. And tell me sweet words like 'you look good the way you are.' najua sikufanya the same but vitu zingine nili hope utajionea tu.</p>
        
        <p>If you live me again, I'm becoming polygamous and braking my protocol Aint giving out to one again😔 so that what she could do me this. I aint ever experiencing this again. I'm a good learner too. Keiii yanu isikuchoche😅 pia ndo io kitu ingine me si entirely stranger kwako so lazima imeplay part kwa hii. Sijui ni expectations high or what did you expect from me that you never found. But dont you think Its unfair jugding one too soon? I might be faking or going thru something for me to be the way I was? </p>
        
        <p>Nakuuliza tena, anaeza kupigania?</p>
        
        <p>Ata ww chukulia venye utachukulia</p>
        
        <p>Aki tu ni venye sipendi confusion. Although my crushout was faking I swear the feeling was real</p>
        
        <p>Yo boy not like dat, not like them other guys</p>
        
        <p>Wish I saw how lucky I was from the start, I would have fought harder. Ningekua adi nasneak shule kukuona to uko precious blood no lie😅 si unanijua tu. Nitakupigia story flani nimewahii jikuta nimevaa shcool girls uniform ku blend in shule flani Embu😅 the things I can do for love if I only did those for fun😅this ain't nothing. You wait. I did tell you to be patient. Just a lil while. And we will have all we ever wanted</p>
        
        <p>At least I deserve a chat</p>
        
        <p>Teach me. I'm lost than you think. I already learnt a few from you</p>
        
        <p>All good no matter your descicion</p>
        
        <p>But I was never to let you go easy. If I do then I'm truly not your mans.</p>

        <p>I wanna paly this game with you but man ,I'm heart paralysed</p>
        
        <p><strong>PS I GOTTA PART II and III one of it got me singing😅</strong> Niliambiwa io itakukunywa mbaya If you like this youll probably love the rest. Kama singekua tech bro ningekua msanii nishakushoo.</p>
        
        <p>This is my final attempt to see your decision. Take time if you need. I just need an honest answer.</p>
        
        <p>Na si compete. We tembea tembea tu. Maybe ndo unadaii. Skuizi naskia akuna mtu anataka ku settle kama hana experience😅 funny retards and they stay in one religion till they die but need experince in other sectors. Utaona kenye nakushoo. Ata kama nakupenda more than you(doubt though) my level aint no one close. But you gotta earn it or it will fade faster than I developed it. Nimejiwaza ,sijawaza we bado youngin😅 little exp is badbad at times. Good with the right mindset. Bad with the wrong company. If you want experience it fully I aint gonna fuzz about it nimeona io ndo mindest ya rika yenu skuizi😅. Its wrong but I cant fight it Hope you remember me all the way</p>
        
        <p>All love though. Just dont come back late😅najua kuachilia kama venye najua kushikilia. Ask dem hands that can map every curve, valley , hills and holes of that ebony bbw rosey scented body of yours. And I'm sure only one pair can map😉 thanks for the experience. You wouldn't even believe how that experience helped even if I told you. The late night calls the profuse calling, it really kept me going with all the noise going on around me nowadays If you see me big know you played a lil part. Directly indirectly</p>
        
        <p>My only regret, I couldn't flood the sheets. Ilikua niipige kama kura ,bahati yako. Ningejua ingefika apa ningechana njugu na mayaii io day. Ama kuna next time, uliniambia next time. Niedelee kukula protein shakes ama niache? mm ilikua nikumaliza your first day😏😂🔪 ilikua ni slaughter io kitty kama me ni Jeffery Dummer. Ungeniita serial killa ju na slaughter type moja pekee. Bhati yako umenikataa. Ilikua mkufe nyi wote</p>

        <p>Me just know this, I have no regrets if I ever find you again waiting for me patientley like you did, I'm up on you. Rough on all the walls. We mapping the whole house. Our body printing sweats and DNA all over the walls/ From the Kitchen to the living room back to the kitchen to the room back to the living room. Hope yo boy richrich we get our own Mansion just to do it all over the garden to the pool. I just might have to eat a lot cause caring all that curve gonna talk a lot😅 But already way ahead. I'm gonna be pulling your hair all the way spanking ,pushing ,diving drilling goddamn and guess what on top of that😅 I'll tell on myself. Coz I've seen you are poor at reading lines </p>
        <p>I'm gonna be bigger than Austin I smell it. Gonna brag it to you. But won't enjoy it without you.</p>
