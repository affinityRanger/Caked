          <p>...as was his dream, his hearts desire. But I fear you dont understand the price, and once you have it ,the price of getting what you want is getting what once you wanted. I saw you and I fell—suddenly, endlessly. Hit me too like a truck. Funny you still hit me like a truck no matter what the outcome. That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you. I swear na si mstari I literally skip a beat when I see a photo of you. Anyway nione mbleina tu nikisema izi vitu😂 Pia ww ulikua mrazi na naona bado uko nayo.</p>
          
          <p>Najua unasoma ii shit ukisema kijana haezi move on. The truth naeza, simple asf. I did briefly for 10yrs look where it got me, she fucking came back. Now she decides to leave after a short stay. Kwani niko predictable aje😔 swear sikua nataka islip</p>
          
          <p>Unanibamba😅 Sina pressure. Nitangoja 10yrs zingine najua kamba ni linear...aint no diversion</p>
          
          <p>Izi ndo matime nilikua natoka shule boarding narudi nikiski kunamtu anasema lazima ni put a ring💍😂😂 usijali. Still rings in my head 👾.Ama unasema ilikua utoto mingi tu? utashtuka ulikua manaseer. With those eyes siezi shtuka. Mesmerized me the day we met. Na nikieza kuambia nilikua nataka kutoka nje nichukue breather io day si ati ni shugli😅 haiya</p>
          
          <p>Mi sikuona ikiwa utoto saaanaa ivooo lakni. Nilikumbushwa na Daniel io story niliishaa😂😂</p>
          
          <p>Experiences zako ni kitu moja nimechora kama tatoo. Sithani itawahi niondokea. Sijawahi kimbishwa ivo na anybody, rather siezi itikia kukimbizwa ivo na anybody. All this bitches got nothin on me and never will. Forever loyal to you. Take it as it is. Swallow water if you have to. Matter of fact come let me give you something that will help swallow.</p>
          
          <p>Anyway, kuongea na ww ilifanya nijue kuna memoria hujasahau.</p>
          
          <p>Acha nkushoo, ata mm sijui hii ni. Might be anything. Might be nothing. Might be I just hate losing playing games with love. Either way niko confused. We ni ka uko na vision and I aint init already😅Goddamit should have been more silent. Izo calls mingi mingi ndo ilifanya nislip words sikua nafaa inaonekana😅 na venye nilijaribu ku avoid convo kathaa, kwani nilisema nn io sijui😅</p>
          
          <p>Still, Dont matter the ties or distance for me that much. Not as you think. I aint going soft next time we meet I can switch lanes faster than I ...I just need an unblock the rest Ill do I know more of you than you think bruh</p>
          
          <p>You think I dont see you sector9? I do 47 or not dont think I be talking bout like I wanna 69... If dont got to know you.</p>
          
          <p>Najua hungefikiria naeza fanya kitu ka hii. Come nikushoo vitu naeza fanya, ata vitu naeza kufanyia siezi. Just becoz you still trusted me.</p>
          
          <p>I also need a sexy Lawyer too. Might come in handy with my 🧠</p>
          
          <p>also I like stars. They give a sense of parmanence.</p>
          
          <p>Look at the difference💜 also look at the similarity💜 of the 2 photos. 2 in 1 you look great in both you look different in both but the same in both. Rare. Like told you...</p>
          
          <p><strong>OPALEFFECT</strong></p>
          
          <p>Just dont treat me like them niggaz I aint those.Basic bros you know. You aint tasted divine yet. Dont run. I never have never will.</p>

          <p>Can I tell you somethin' Crazy too I never thought you'd be my type too since we met at the beginning Till that day you came from school and I switched school. That was not naive the way we looked at each other we craved for each other. I saw you young at first. I said fuck dat from that day. My first real experience. No lie. Was void before. I was actually gonna give up on things till you came back. And I was like mmh maybe just maybe. Then I started doing things different not knowing or caring how it may affect this us. My bad. Should have gone harder than my D when you crossed your legs sitting on your side. Gotta bounce it one more time before you even think of leaving me.</p>
          
          <p>I guess its why I'm still here. Unless I wasnt your first then I am wrong in everything. Dilussional asf.</p>
          
          <p>If you knew how resentful I tried being. It kept slipping each time. I'll explain when I want. I'm telling I got a lot to tell you. Before your descision</p>
          
          <p>The song TRAUMA is word for word what I'm trying to say</p>
          
          <p>We were gonna be on a beach high together. You fr sweared. Ama uliniona uka sema I'm too skinny😂. I promise its only my arms and legs. I mean you did see😔</p>
          
          <p>I'm not doing all this to prove a point. I think I'll continue doing that for a while as we discover this. Naeza kua adi nakuchukia obsesively ata mm si get.</p>
          
          <p>Let me show you what I'm saying, If it it dont work out is cool. I can stay as frfrrrfriends in the long. Cool friends. Might even be ur best man in your wedding😊 Then we can maybe think of Bonnie and Clyde'n our way out😵😂🔪 But we dont got to be a thing baby, at my own pase. At the end you won't have anything to think much.</p>
          
          <p>This aint love bombing😂 not yet at least😏</p>
          
          <p>Fair I add mine just incase it leaks😅 I guess this is us back in 2013. Ukiwa hizo photo session sikua ,nikiwa hukua. Its still in the web. Encrypted ,but you how it goes when you come on top. It aint gonna be fun without you. Never will. I'll survive but I'll die.</p>

(reminds me of Spiderman and jane in spider man 3 only this time after eating each other out they kiss and go home) It consumes the male. Walks out elegant sassy but sexy. Abdomen High 🍑. But the male wants it. You know why, well they dont talk. Might be love or somethin</p>

        <p>My love Dangerous. And unstable. It needs someone with heart for sure.</p>
        
        <p>Without this, love and sex are are two seperate things for me😔 never felt anything in my sexual life till at lulu. I dont get why you pretend it aint mutual.</p>
        
        <p>Its mostly not About you. But also about you. Its mostly about what I'm about to be. Its not gonna be full without you. Literally.</p>
        
        <p>I also like peaches 🍑. Not all types. You gotta be picky with that fruit. Its a delicate one. Thats why expensive. And a rare fruit. It needs good hands. The softer the better. It tends to harvest the juiciest fruits.</p>

        <p>Aki tu ni venye sipendi confusion. Although my crushout was faking I swear the feeling was real</p>
        
        <p>Yo boy not like dat, not like them other guys</p>
        
        <p>Wish I saw how lucky I was from the start</p>
        
        <p>At least I deserve a chat</p>
        
        <p>Plizz teach me. I already learnt a few from you</p>
        
        <p>All Love💜 no matter your desicion just know I aint giving up easy</p>
        
        <p>If I do then I'm truly not your mans.</p>
        
        <p><strong>PS I GOTTA PART II and III one of it got me singing😅</strong> Niliambiwa io itakukunywa mbaya If you like this youll probably love the rest. Kama singekua tech bro ningekua msanii nishakushoo.</p>
        
        <p>This is my final attempt to see your decision. Take time if you need. I just need an honest answer.</p>
        
        <p>Na si compete. We tembea tembea tu. Utaona kenye nakushoo. Ata kama nakupenda more than you(doubt though) my level aint no one close. But you gotta earn it or it will fade faster than I developed it. Nimejiwaza sijawaza we bado youngin😅 little exp is badbad at times. If you want experience it fully I aint gonna fuzz about it. Hope you remember me all the way</p>
        
        <p>All love though. Just dont come back late😅najua kuachilia kama venye najua kushikilia. Ask dem hands that can map every curve, valley , hills and holes of that ebony bbw rosey scented body of yours. And I'm sure only one pair can map😉 thanks for the experience. You wouldnt even believe how that experience helped even if I told you.</p>
        
        <p>My only regret, I couldn't flood the sheets. Ilikua niipige kama kura bahati yako.</p>
