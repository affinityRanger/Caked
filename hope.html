          <p>...as was his dream, his hearts desire. But I fear you dont understand the price, and once you have it ,the price of getting what you want is getting what once you wanted. I saw you and I fell—suddenly, endless .Hit me too like a truck. Funny you still hit me like a truck no matter what the outcome. That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you. I swear na si mstari I literally skip a beat when I see a photo of you. Anyway nione mbleina tu nikisema izi vitu😂 Pia ww ulikua mrazi na naona bado uko nayo.</p>
          
          <p>Najua unasoma ii shit ukisema kijana haezi move on. Naeza jaribu. I did briefly for 10yrs look where it got me, she fucking came back. </p>
          
          <p>Unanibamba😅 tu sana.If you really serious about your love life and not just worldly desires then damn, 'Can I ride with you? you can hold my ruger' Its my curiosity killing me at this point not even the rejection. Like why did you accept my request, came back to me, told me all you told me agreed to meet me even after all those months, you fuckin shaved🥵😌 you lil nasty thot🍉 mistake or not😂💜 not a mistake someebody wanted the coco slippperry  somebody lying saying we couldnt be a thing before we met😅. Or your body craved me or the feeling? funny we almost fucked. I'll need better context, seems I'm not your level or something. Of which I'll ask how low is that bar set? I cant tell the details well. Here atleast. CMW .That dude gon be a lil lucky. He just needs to be a lil more careful next time(me speaking to the future me) Na kwani uliipaka nn ju imekua ngumu kwangu kukusahau? Na nilkua nashanga io taste ya pinnaple strawberry punch imetoka wapi na niliskia inaonjanga steel copper wire. Maze siezi enda clubing adi kwa amani. Nikiona stripper na fumble. Kenye ilikua imekosa tu ni pole kule lulu😏 ju the way that black and white thing hugged those peaches🍑 damnnnn🥵 sit on me again. Siezi adi skia jina ina rhyme na 'Sam'  Naskia mtu anasema today the 'sun is hot' me naskia Sam is hot nachizi. Heri mtu aite jua. Ningekua na Kingdom yangu ningeburn io jina. Naskia imetajwa " guards execute that fucker"  isikue ulinitepa. Not cool.</p>
          
          <p>Izi ndo matime nilikua natoka shule boarding narudi nikiski kunamtu anasema lazima ni put a ring on her💍😂😂 how innocent and Naive.Usijali. Still rings in my head 👾. Willing to make your dream come true to the old ages. Coz if you let me mine automatically alligns I wanna grow old beside you. Or not.Ama unasema ilikua utoto mingi tu? utashtuka ulikua manaseer. With those eyes siezi shtuka. Mesmerized me the day we met. Na nikieza kuambia nilikua nataka kutoka nje nichukue breather io day si ati ni shugli😅 haiya</p>
          
          <p>Mi sikuona ikiwa utoto saaanaa ivooo lakni. Nilikumbushwa io story niliishaa😂😂</p>
          
          <p>Experiences zako ni kitu moja nimechora kama tatoo. Sithani itawahi niondokea. Sijawahi kimbishwa ivo na anybody, rather siezi itikia kukimbizwa ivo na anybody tena for sure. No matter the outcome this 2 months will mould my coming descisions fo sure All this bitches got nothin on me and never will. Forever loyal to you. But I would feel awful If I dont get a chance. But I cannot force shit, just try. Only Time tells the true tale all other things are mere thoughts realities we try to allign with time. Take it as it is. Swallow water if you have to. Matter of fact come let me give you something that will help swallow.</p>
          
          <p>Anyway, kuongea na ww ilifanya nijue kuna memoria hujasahau. Ata useme our past was awful. You showed me it wasnt purely as you say nor as I say.</p>
          
          <p>Acha nkushoo, ata mm sijui hii ni nn. Might be anything. Might be nothing. Might be I just hate losing playing games with love. Either way niko confused. But na feel kitu. But si anger but ni kitu haitaki niondokee. We ni ka uko na vision and I aint init already if the other side was your choice😅Goddamit should have been more silent. Izo calls mingi mingi ndo ilifanya nislip words sikua nafaa inaonekana😅 bado nili mean kila shiet, mostly.</p>
          
          <p>Still, Dont matter the ties or distance for me that much. Not as you think. Not for now. I aint going soft next time we meet I can switch lanes faster than I can undress. Can you unblock I get the chance to ignore you too. When blocked it feels like cheating or forced.</p>
          
          <p>You think I dont see you dr9? 47 or not dont think I be talking bout like I wanna 69... If I dont got to know you more than I do</p>
          
          <p>Najua hungefikiria naeza fanya kitu ka hii. Ama uli expect ju nimeji exposee kiasi 😏 it was a matter oftime anyway. Come nikushoo vitu naeza fanya, or not your loss. Men are the only ones who love, Women tend to Love the moment thats why they usually have backups or replacements and move on faster. I saw it different with us. A connection or bond that looks hard to bend. Thats why I was mesmarized. I would usually ask myself whats this? You know where I stay and the girls I tend to meet often. So I did not beleive you at first. If you did all this It is kind of my fault I didn't move steady also the timing played part. Never gave you the story. Might talk. Or not.</p>
          
          <p>I also need a sexy Lawyer too. Might come in handy with my 🧠</p>
          
          <p>also I like stars. They give a sense of parmanence.</p>
          
          <p>Look at the difference💜 also look at the similarity💜 of the 2 photos. 2 in 1 you look great in both you look different in both but the same in both. Rare. Like I told you...</p>
          
          <p><strong>OPALEFFECT</strong></p>
          
          <p>Just dont treat me like them niggaz you know I aint those basic bros . You aint tasted divine yet. Dont run. I never have never will.</p>

          <p>Can I tell you somethin' Crazy too I never thought you'd be my type too since we met at the beginning . I actually thought no one can be my type around here. Was into other drunk types. Till that day you came from school and I switched school. The timing was perfect since my thoughts started tuning to you prier that moment. So I guess it was mutual. That was not naive the way we looked at each other we craved for each other. I saw you young at first. I said fuck dat from that day. Started with a hug. Ended in kisses. Learn from you to be a kisser even then.My first real experience. No lie. Was void before. I was actually gonna give up on things till you came back. And I was like mmh maybe just maybe. Then I started doing things different not knowing or caring how it may affect this us. My bad. Should have gone harder than my D when you crossed your legs sitting on your side. Gotta bounce it one more time before you even think of leaving me.</p>
          
          <p>I guess its why I'm still here. Unless I wasnt your first then I am wrong in everything. Dilussional asf. Ivo ndo naskia naitwa na ww skuizi. Cant a man dream and archive the desired, I mean don't you dream too?</p>
          
          <p>If you knew how resentful I tried being. It kept slipping I see that now. I'll explain when I want. I'm telling I got a lot to tell. </p>
          
          <p>The song TRAUMA is word for word what I'm trying to say, chill song, good song ?      🤔.</p>
          
          <p>We were gonna be high together. You fr sweared tukiwa rooftop I cant tell what went wrong. But can we can fuck that shit out girl. Be straight with me. I'll crucify you for the nature of human longing is to be free.</p>
          
          <p>I'm not doing all this to prove a point. I think I'll continue doing that for a while as we discover this. Or maybe not. Naeza kua adi nakuchukia obsessively ata mm si get.</p>
          
          <p>Let me know when you want me to start showing what I'm saying, If it it dont work out is cool. Might even be ur best man in your wedding😊 Then we can maybe think of Bonnie and Clyde'n our way out😵😂🔪 But we dont got to be a thing baby, at my own pase your own pleasure. At the end you won't have anything to think much.</p>
          
          <p>This aint love bombing😂 not yet at least😏</p>
          
          <p>Fair I add mine just incase it leaks😅 I guess this is us back in 2013. Ukiwa hizo photo session sikua ,nikiwa hukua. Its still in the web. Encrypted ,but you know how it goes when you come on top. It aint gonna be fun without you. Never will. I'll survive but I'll die.</p>

        <p>Start by clicking the name PS:From now you my BLACK WIDOW<strong>🕷️🕸️</strong>. The way you sting and bite. Do you know what it does to its male after sex on a web? (reminds me of Spiderman and jane in spider man 3 only this time after eating each other out they kiss and go home) It consumes the male. Walks out elegant sassy but sexy. Abdomen High 🍑. But the male wants it. You know why, well they dont talk. Might be love or something. But the fact that something can be both Fatal and attractive is buy itself the ultimate addiction.</p>
        
        <p>The music you here when you open this page is a song you told me you love.</p>
        
        <p>The rest of the songs I have hand picked. Ulisema huezi skiza JW3 ,we ni namble ni venye hungam bado lakini skiza sahii unishoo rating sasa kama ako higher or lower. Some you are familiar with maybe some not.</p>
        
        <p>I dont know whenever, I hear DREAMING it just gives me your vibe. Its ingrained in me already. Not the music but the feeling.And this girls play it a lot.</p>
        
        <p>Imagine the tourture😞</p>
        
        <p>I also just Discovered my hypocrisy. I have never really done anything for you. Consider this my first sentimental attempt to what I'm to say and do till my last.</p>
        
        <p>My love Dangerous. And unstable. It needs someone with heart for sure. But nimeona venye unanichukulia hujui anything bado😅</p>
        
        <p>Without you love and sex are are two seperate things for me forever. Move on if you must but no this, ain't no one ever gonna be your biggest fan than me😔 never felt anything or anyone till at you then left then voidness again then lulu then I died that day it seems. I've just realized late. You made me feel like a king. Din't I make you feel like a Black queen you are? If I'm not wrong I did acknowlegde my Queen. I bowed for my Royal ,technically from the back but yeah or you thought it was mixed feelings. I never bow to any other Queen. Loyalty. Never will. If you see me with any other or hear just know she will never get to be bowed by me. She gotta cheat for that. I dont get why you pretend it aint mutual.</p>
        
        <p>Its mostly not About you. But also about you. Its mostly about what I'm about to be. Its not gonna be full without you. Literally.</p>
        
        <p>I also like peaches 🍑. Not all types. You gotta be picky with that fruit. Its a delicate one. Thats why expensive. And a rare fruit. It needs good hands. The softer the better. It tends to harvest the juiciest fruits.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Tell yo Mama Hi😊</strong></p>
        
        <p>CALL ME but dont call me Crazy YET!! DONT STOP ME NOW</p>
        
        <p>PS: Its a disappearing browser. Will automatically delete in 2wks time.</p>
        
        <p>Trying to say uoy dmc so plizz cmw. I'll be waiting</p>
        
        <p>Na usini expose mm👺 hapo sasa mm ndo nitakudinya ww na nikukalie, si ww. Haiya ulinikalia bytha😂😂😏💍</p>
        
        <p>Nikupatie clue ujue kama uyo your current mans ni ur mans,kama mmeingia lulu kama sisi na hajakuambia tumbo ni kubwa dumb him quick.</p>

        <p>I'm no Drake nor PND but my name still Bryson still a rocker. Give me the location. I learnt a thing or two since we met.😎</p>
        
        <p>I don't even know if I'm doing corny things here or if you'll even like it. I also dont think I care if you do that much. Hii si for you its also for me. Nimejitengenezea pia</p>
        
        <p>But I also feel this would have been sugar melon sweet if it was in better terms😅</p>
        
        <p><strong>I just pressed the big red button😂</strong></p>
        
        <p>Damn that big read button😖memories😌 Damn that big red button Started all dat. Couldn't resist . But who wouldn't, remember I asked what the fuk, why does it taste like strawberrry pinapple punch😔Damn that big red button.</p>
        
        <p>Was gonna put it in a yellow diamond pendant or somthin' maybe half black to match ur attitude half purple to mean love war. But I aint rich though,yet, a yellow diamond dagger will get if you choose this side. I know you will. Question is will I be patient enough till that day? or will you</p>
        
        <p>Its hard here gettin over you. I'm past this bitches,I think. Discovered a Woman. Now I just look at this bitches like souless dolls. Like you but uglierversion of you without the misrouted part</p>
        
        <p>I've been messing around with this game for a while till I saw how serious You are. Then I lost my cool. Then you blocked me, I knew I aint going back. This letter might look like damage controll. Because it kind of is. But remember I have been asking you for your photos. It was an Idea like this.</p>
        
        <p>It was sopposed to be a suprise, just to say forget the old me.</p>
        
        <p>If you knew how safe I played not to fumble into you 😔. I have a problem with hot girls that treat me good. Especially after they touch my hair.</p>
        
        <p>Call it whatever you want. You can phrase it how you like. I did mean everyword I said.</p>
        
        <p>This is instinct I guess.</p>
        
        <p>If you live me again, I'm becoming polygamous. Aint giving out to one again😔</p>
        
        <p>Nakuuliza tena, anaeza kupigania?</p>
        
        <p>Ata ww chukulia venye utachukulia</p>
        
        <p>Aki tu ni venye sipendi confusion. Although my crushout was faking I swear the feeling was real</p>
        
        <p>Yo boy not like dat, not like them other guys</p>
        
        <p>Wish I saw how lucky I was from the start</p>
        
        <p>At least I deserve a chat</p>
        
        <p>Teach me. I'm lost than you think. I already learnt a few from you</p>
        
        <p>All good no matter your descicion</p>
        
        <p>If I do then I'm truly not your mans.</p>
        
        <p><strong>PS I GOTTA PART II and III one of it got me singing😅</strong> Niliambiwa io itakukunywa mbaya If you like this youll probably love the rest. Kama singekua tech bro ningekua msanii nishakushoo.</p>
        
        <p>This is my final attempt to see your decision. Take time if you need. I just need an honest answer.</p>
        
        <p>Na si compete. We tembea tembea tu. Utaona kenye nakushoo. Ata kama nakupenda more than you(doubt though) my level aint no one close. But you gotta earn it or it will fade faster than I developed it. Nimejiwaza ,sijawaza we bado youngin😅 little exp is badbad at times. Good with the right mindset. Bad with the wrong company. If you want experience it fully I aint gonna fuzz about it. Hope you remember me all the way</p>
        
        <p>All love though. Just dont come back late😅najua kuachilia kama venye najua kushikilia. Ask dem hands that can map every curve, valley , hills and holes of that ebony bbw rosey scented body of yours. And I'm sure only one pair can map😉 thanks for the experience. You wouldnt even believe how that experience helped even if I told you. If you see me big know you played a lil part. Directly indirectly</p>
        
        <p>My only regret, I couldn't flood the sheets. Ilikua niipige kama kura bahati yako.</p>
