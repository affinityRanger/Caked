          Can I tell you somethin' Crazy too I never thought you'd be my type too since we met at the beginning Till that day you came from school and I switched school. That was not naive the way we looked at each other we craved for each other. I saw you young at first. I said fuck dat from that day. My first real experience with somebody was with you. No lie
            <br><br>Izi ndo matime natoka shule boarding narudi nikiski kunamtu anasema lazima nimvalishe pete😂😂 usijali. Ama unasema ilikua utoto mingi tu?
          <br><br>I guess its why I'm still here. Unless I wasnt your first then I am right in everything
          <br><br>If you get knew how resentful I tried being from the first about how I felt. It kept slipping each time. I'll explain further dont worry. I'm telling I got a lot to tell you. Before your descision
          <br><br>The song TRAUMA is word for word what I'm trying to say
          <br><br>We were gonna be on a beach high together. You fr sweared
          <br><br>I'm not doing all this to prove a point. I think I'll continue doing that for a while as we dicover this.

        I need you so much. I want you to get that bad. I'm no Drake nor PND but my name still Bryson still a rocker. Give me the location. I learnt a thing or two since we met.😎
        <br><br>I don't even know if I'm doing corny things here or if you'll even like it. Honestly if you like I don't mind looking like a geek.

        <br><br>Its true I cant get over you. I'm past this bitches,I think. Discovered a Woman.
        <br><br>The first 2 weeks afer whatever we broke happened I was joking around. Till later then I knew I aint going back.
        <br><br>If you knew how safe I played not to fumble into you 😔. I have a problem with hot girls that treat me good. Especially after they touch my hair.
        <br><br>Call it whatever you want. You can phrase it how you like. I did mean everyword I said.
        <br><br>This is instinct I guess.
    
        <br><br>If you live me again I dont think I'm ever recovering again.
