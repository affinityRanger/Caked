        Can I tell you somethin' Crazy I never thought you'd be my type too since we met at the beginning. Till that day you came from school and I switched school. That was not naive the way we looked at each other we craved for each other. I saw you young at first. I said fuck dat from that day. My first real experience with somebody was with you. No lie
        <p>I guess its why I'm still here. Unless I wasnt your first then I am right in everything</p>
