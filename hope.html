          ...as was his dream, his hearts desire. But I fear you dont understand the price, and once you have it ,the price of getting what you want is getting what once you wanted.
          I saw you and I fell—suddenly, endlessly. Hit me too like a truck. Funny you still hit me like a truck no matter what the outcome. That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you. I swear na si mstari I literally skip a beat when I see a photo of you. Anyway nione mbleina tu nikisema izi vitu😂
          <br><br>I was so scared of being attached you wouldnt believe after what I'm doing. I wish I went in as you said.😞
          <br><br>But I also dont😅 I kinda know the outcome I guess. You mostly are the choice maker.
          <br><br>Izi ndo matime nilikua natoka shule boarding narudi nikiski kunamtu anasema lazima nimvalishe pete😂😂 usijali. Ama unasema ilikua utoto mingi tu? utashtuka ulikua seer. With those eyes siezi shtuka. Mesmerized me the day we met. Na nikieza kuambia nilikua nataka kutoka nje nichukue breather😅 
          <br><br>Mi sikuona ikiwa utoto saaanaa ivooo lakni
          <br><br>Kuna wtu siezi sahau experiences no matter what.
          <br><br>Anyway, kuongea na ww ilifanya nijue kuna vitu poa hujasahau.
          <br><br>Ata mm sijui hii ni. Might be anything. Might be nothing. Might be I just hate losing playing games with love.
          <br><br>All I know, I need you. Dont matter the ties or distance for me that much. Not as you think. I aint going soft next time. I can switch lanes faster than I ...
          <br><br>You think I dont see you sector9? I do 47 or not dont think I be talking bout like I wanna 69... If dont got to know you.
          <br><br>I cant do it alone. Everything
          <br><br>I also need a sexy Lawyer too. Might come in handy with my 🧠
          <br><br>also like stars. They give a sense of parmanence.
          <br><br>Look at the difference💜 also look at the similarity💜 of the 2 photos. 2 in 1 you look great in both you look different in both but the same in both. Rare. Like told you...
          <br><br><strong>OPALEFFECT</strong> 
          <br><br>Just dont treat me like them niggaz I aint those.Basic bros you know. You aint tasted divine yet. Dont run. I never have never will.

          Can I tell you somethin' Crazy too I never thought you'd be my type too since we met at the beginning Till that day you came from school and I switched school. That was not naive the way we looked at each other we craved for each other. I saw you young at first. I said fuck dat from that day. My first real experience with somebody was with you. No lie
            <br><br>Izi ndo matime natoka shule boarding narudi nikiski kunamtu anasema lazima nimvalishe pete😂😂 usijali. Ama unasema ilikua utoto mingi tu?
          <br><br>I guess its why I'm still here. Unless I wasnt your first then I am right in everything
          <br><br>If you knew how resentful I tried being from the first about how I felt. It kept slipping each time. I'll explain further dont worry. I'm telling I got a lot to tell you. Before your descision
          <br><br>The song TRAUMA is word for word what I'm trying to say
          <br><br>We were gonna be on a beach high together. You fr sweared
          <br><br>I'm not doing all this to prove a point. I think I'll continue doing that for a while as we discover this.
          <br><br>Let me show you what I'm saying, If it it dont work out in the long is cool. I can stay as frfrrrfriends in the long. Cool friends. Might even be ur best man in your wedding😊 Then we can maybe think of Bonnie and Clyde'n our way out😵😂🔪 But we dont got to be a thing baby, at my own pase. At the end you won't have anything to think much. I promise you dis. Although you started. From now😅thats if.
          <br><br>This aint love bombing😂 not yet at least😏

        Start by clicking the name PS:From now you my BLACK WIDOW<strong>🕷️🕸️</strong>. The way you sting and bite. Do you know what it does to its male after sex on a web? (reminds me of Spiderman and jane in spider man 3  only this time after eating each other out they kiss and go home) It consumes it. Walks out elegant sassy but sexy. Abdomen High 🍑. But the male wants it. You know why well they dont talk. Might be love or somethin
        <br><br>The music you here when you open this page is a song you told me you love.
        <br><br>The rest of the songs I have hand picked to explain myself. Some you are familiar with maybe some not.
        <br><br>I dont know whenever I hear DREAMING it just gives me your vibe. Its ingrained in me already. Not the music but the feeling.And this girls play it a lot.
        <br><br>Imagine the tourture😞
        <br><br>I also just Discovered my hypocricy. I have never really done anything for you. Consider this my first sentimental attempt to what I'm to say and do till my last.
        <br><br>My love Dangerous. And unstable. It needs someone with heart for sure.
        <br><br>Without this, love and sex are are two seperate things for me😔
        <br><br>Its mostly not Abou you. But also about you. Its mostly about what I'm about to be. Its not gonaabe full without you. Literally.
        <br><br>I also like peaches btw 🍑. Not all types. You gotta be picky with that fruit. Its a delicate one. Thats why expensive. And a rare fruit. It needs good hands. The softer the better. It tends to harvest the juiciest fruits. 
          <br><br><strong>Tell yo Mama Hi😊</strong>
        <br><br>CALL ME but dont call me Crazy. YET!! DONT STOP ME NOW
        <br><br>PS: Its a disappearing browser. Will automatically delete in 2wks time.
